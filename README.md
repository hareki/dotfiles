- These are just config files, please make sure to install the packages as well

- I use [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage my dotfiles, which handles symlinks to ensure that the files in my dotfiles repository stay synchronized with the actual configuration files. I also cooked some util functions to smoothen the process, which you can find at my [lazy-functions](https://github.com/hareki/dotfiles/blob/main/zsh/.zsh/lazy-functions)

- Major areas include `zsh` and `nvim`
